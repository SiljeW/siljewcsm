                                to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.

                                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring 
                                and understanding our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet 
                                and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet

                                Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs 
                                including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
                                Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
